<h1>Simulation of an Employee Database using Python</h1>

<strong>Task:</strong> write a program that simulates an employee database system. The project serves two main purposes: 
<ul>
  <li>to provide practice in writing programs that manipulate strings, data structures, and files.</li>
  <li>to apply sorting and searching algorithms.</li>
</ul>

<strong>1 -</strong> The computer first displays a login form. There are two user types in this system: Admin - Users. If the user enters “admin” as username and “admin123123” as password, the system will
show the admin menu. Else, if a normal user logs in, a different menu will be shown. If any user inputs an incorrect combination, the system should display “Incorrect Username and/or Password”. The user is not allowed to enter more than 5 wrong combinations. Otherwise, the menu of the system will be displayed.

<strong>2 -</strong> Admin can: Display Statistics, Add an Employee, Display all Employees, Change Employee’s Salary, Remove Employee, Raise Employee’s Salary, and Exit

<strong>3 -</strong> If the user logged in is a normal employee, the following menu will be displayed after greeting by the following message: “Hi Mr. ...” or “Hi Ms. ...”. The user can: Check their Salary or Exit

<strong>4 -</strong> After each option, the menu is displayed again. The user can use the system multiple times.
